Of course, the websites come and go, entire provinces disappear, but the information stays there in some form, in search engine caches, in the Wayback Machine, often copied across multiple sites. Or so I hoped recently, while looking for a paella recipe, which I originally found around ten years ago and then used, with some success, through the years. No luck.</description></item><item><title>Flooded Queensland Penne</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/flooded-queensland-penne/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/flooded-queensland-penne/</guid><description>January 2011 found us in eastern Australia, desperately trying to get to from Cairns to Sydney in time for our flight back home. Despite having a few weeks at our disposal, us reaching Sydney on time was far from certain, due to epic floods that affected much of coastal Queensland. So, we drove around trying to find a passable way South, coming across what looked like deserted towns, with empty shelves at grocery stores and rationed bread, as supplies could not be delivered due to flooded roads.</description></item><item><title>One Pound Soup</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/one-pound-soup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/one-pound-soup/</guid><description>I took my first steps towards independent, adult living one summer in the middle of my university course. I stayed for two months in a shared apartment in central London. It was a summer internship, well paid, but not being used to a regular income, freaked out by the prices of everything in London being a few times higher than in Warsaw, I tried to live on a very tight budget of £50 a week – that included food and tube tickets.</description></item><item><title>Jamie's Fish</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/jamies-fish/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/jamies-fish/</guid><description>There are recipes that I gleaned from the Internet, and which I am very fond of. It would be presumptious and unfair to the fine people who first published them online to plagiarise their efforts on this humble blog. But then, if I had prepared a certain dish dozens of times, if I made custom adjustments and modifications, if the sequence of activities is so ingrained in my synapses that preparing it is like driving a car or putting my shoes on – then perhaps it is fair game, after all?</description></item><item><title>Pink Soup</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/pink-soup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/pink-soup/</guid><description>From my childhood I remember that to maintain the staple lunch of a soup and a main course through the summer heatwaves, the soup had to be replaced with a cold, often milk-based concoction. It is a peculiarly eastern European thing. From Balkans to the Baltic, from tarator to cold borscht, you will find a multitude of summer recipes for a cold soup. Somehow, the westerners often find the idea repulsive.</description></item><item><title>Arabba Fennel salad, cold or hot</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/arabba-fennel-salad-cold-or-hot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/arabba-fennel-salad-cold-or-hot/</guid><description>A skiing week in a rented apartment usually means serious culinary constraints. So, we have picked the location that is close to the slopes, so that we do not have to take a bus, or walk for 20 minutes in ski boots, and that is not going to break the bank – but other considerations, such as well-equipped kitchen or proximity to the shops inevitably were of secondary importance. We could eat in the resturant, sure, but if we could afford the extortionate prices the resort eateries charge, then presumably we could have stayed in a proper hotel instead of a holiday apartment?</description></item><item><title>What do you do with celeriac</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/what-do-you-do-with-celeriac/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/what-do-you-do-with-celeriac/</guid><description>Having decided to live apart from civilisation, on the outskirts of a tiny hamlet, two hundred thousand souls, I am at the mercy of my local Tesco as far as food supplies are concerned. Some years ago they decided to stop carrying avocados for a few months. Imagine that! You city folks do not understand what real hardship is. Now there is no celeriac. Last autumn celeriac was in constant supply, but somehow it has fallen out of favour this year.</description></item><item><title>Elegy to the Bliss</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/elegy-to-the-bliss/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/elegy-to-the-bliss/</guid><description>I met Katja at Barleylands Farmers Market near Billericay. She was selling various smoked goods, of which some – sea salt, garlic, cheese – looked weird, but whole trout caught my attention. Katja told me it can be eaten cold or heated up and served with potatoes, the latter of which I found a bit surprising. In the end I tried it cold, on a sandwich with home-made sourdough rye bread, and it was glorious.</description></item><item><title>Ketosis No. 2</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/ketosis-no.-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/ketosis-no.-2/</guid><description>Have you heard of ketosis? No? Apparently it’s the best thing since the sliced bread, only even better, because there is no bread, so no need to slice anything. There is no bread, because ketosis is all about getting your energy from fat. Apparently a chap has done it for a year, lost weight, has better cholesterol and some other metrics, feels great. Right, count me in. But, the scientific way to do it is being very exact with amounts of all the food ingredients, and really struggling to find foodstuffs which are fatty enough.</description></item><item><title>Sailor Fodder</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/sailor-fodder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/sailor-fodder/</guid><description>Picture this: you try to bring a massive pot of water to boil to cook some rice. The meal was supposed to be served 15 minutes ago, and the water still refuses to boil. Suddenly, the floor lurches from underneath your feet, you are violently thrown against the cooker and only a small miracle saves you from third-degree burns. Eventually, you manage to put some rice into the water, and after another half an hour there is some hope it might have softened a little.</description></item><item><title>Sans Marigold</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/sans-marigold/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/sans-marigold/</guid><description>I like travelling a lot – that is, I like it a lot to travel, rather than travelling a lot is what I like – getting to know different cultures, cuisines, all that stuff. Those of you who understand Polish, or are willing to suffer automated translation, can read more about my travel exploits on another blog. This year I have been to Greece and Georgia, and if there is anything common between those two escapades, it is that in those lands of highly regarded cuisine I ended up enjoying salads the most.</description></item><item><title>The Loin of Patience</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/the-loin-of-patience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/the-loin-of-patience/</guid><description>When I was younger I could not understand the social imperative to treat people older than oneself – in particular the elderly – with esteem. In what way does having lived through a number of decades entitle one to more respect than is shown to a similarly worthy youth? With time I started to appreciate the worth of experience and accept that there are qualities that come with age. One such quality that is stereotypically associated with the elderly and denied the young is patience.</description></item><item><title>A Proper Fruit Salad</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/a-proper-fruit-salad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/a-proper-fruit-salad/</guid><description>Fruit salads do not enjoy a good reputation, and perhaps deservedly so. At supermarkets and sandwich joints, what passes as a “fruit salad” is usually nothing more than some random pieces of fruit approaching use-by date diced and sealed in a plastic container. At restaurants, dietetic martyrs who with sad resignation skim through the dessert menu and then announce they will have a fruit salad, attract sympathetic looks and knowing nods.</description></item><item><title>Pig's Legs in Aspic</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/pigs-legs-in-aspic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/pigs-legs-in-aspic/</guid><description>I am a fussy eater. When at primary school, I refused to partake of the simple and filling lunches we were served at the canteen, and when asked by a concerned lunch lady what the hell I am eating at home reportedly responded with veal fillet and fries. That was in soviet-era Poland, mind you, where meat was rationed, citizens were prepared to queue for hours to get hold of a frozen carcass of starved and abused chicken and brawls were commonly breaking out over who gets the right to buy the last paper-filled frankfurter.</description></item><item><title>Tesco Finest Salad</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/tesco-finest-salad/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/tesco-finest-salad/</guid><description>After moving to London to live on my own, I rented a one bed flat located on the top floor of a 16-story high tower block. It was a 1970s, local authority building, and the unquestionable advantages of awesome view over the city, proximity to work and affordability were somewhat counterbalanced by extreme heat in the summer, biting cold in the winter and the council tenants taking their bull terriers to relieve themselves in the lift.</description></item><item><title>Wild Boar Fillet à la Białowieża</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/wild-boar-fillet-%C3%A0-la-bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/wild-boar-fillet-%C3%A0-la-bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa/</guid><description>There is often that one ingredient. You’re in a supermarket and a vegetable you don’t normally eat catches your eye, or it’s a jar of some obscure substance that suddenly seems like a promising kernel around which you can build a dinner. Or, it’s something rare, that you got from someone and sits in your pantry waiting for that moment of inspiration. This evening’s dish is going to be of this kind.</description></item><item><title>せっかちな人のためのうどん</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/%E3%81%9B%E3%81%A3%E3%81%8B%E3%81%A1%E3%81%AA%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AE%E3%81%86%E3%81%A9%E3%82%93/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/%E3%81%9B%E3%81%A3%E3%81%8B%E3%81%A1%E3%81%AA%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AE%E3%81%86%E3%81%A9%E3%82%93/</guid><description>For people of occidental origin such as myself, the first degree of initiation in Wagamama’s menu is invariably Chicken Katsu Curry. Those who dare to abandon the comfortable familiarity of breaded chicken, rice, and sauce not altogether unlike the gravy often served with traditional English pies will arrive in the land of wok-fried udon noodles – that’s the second degree, and this what I have so far achieved. I can only guess what happens further, but would venture a supposition that one must at some point attain the level of a bowl of ramen, which, according to Wagamama’s own advertising, seems to be what every fashionable young person orders there.</description></item><item><title>The Making of a Burrito</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/the-making-of-a-burrito/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/the-making-of-a-burrito/</guid><description>A couple of years ago a new take-away moved into what used to be a dental practice directly beneath the platform of a Docklands Light Railway station. The establishment called itself “Tortilla” – a fitting, if somewhat unimaginative name for a place that sells burritos. Given that it was just next door to where I used to work at the time, it didn’t take me – a long-time chilli con carne buff – to become a regular.</description></item><item><title>Pollo con Pancetta alla Avanzi</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/pollo-con-pancetta-alla-avanzi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/pollo-con-pancetta-alla-avanzi/</guid><description>For quite a while I have been relying on recipes scavenged from various corners of the web, with little added creativity. There are some which I would like to share my take on, like Jamie’s fish linguine – I even have a nice photo taken already – but going for something so much borrowed would require considerable literary embellishment, which recently I have felt incapable of.
So, Jamie’s fish will have to wait; meanwhile, leftovers to the rescue of creative spirit!</description></item><item><title>Roasted Root Vegetables</title><link>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/roasted-root-vegetables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mmakowski.github.io/blog/cooking/roasted-root-vegetables/</guid><description>Commonly when preparing the main course we start with the choice of meat (if any) and the way to cook it, and then treat the vegetables, rice etc. as an addition. For today’s course I’m doing something opposite: make vegetables the cetrepiece, with meat acting as a side dish. The first time I ate something similar was in December 2009 in Lapland, with -30°C outside, so somehow naturally I associate it with winter.</description></item></channel></rss>
