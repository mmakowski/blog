I stayed for two months in a shared apartment in central London. It was a summer internship, well paid, but not being used to a regular income, freaked out by the prices of everything in London being a few times higher than in Warsaw, I tried to live on a very tight budget of £50 a week – that included food and tube tickets. Let it be a testament to my frugality that at the end of the eight-week internship I managed to shave enough off these weekly allowances to afford a digital camera, Kyocera FC-S3, that must have cost more than 200 pounds at the time.</p><p>Needless to say, spending money on food seemed like a wasteful luxury. I seem to recall cheddar on toast for breakfast and as a packed lunch. A lot of spaghetti in tomato sauce must also have been involved, for sure. Once I tried to make rice in a pot covered with a glass lid, which I put in an oven. The lid shattered, but I was determined to not let the rice go to waste and eat it anyway; fortunately, my more sensible flatmate talked me out of it.</p><p>My culinary experimentation usually took the form of mimicry, and the memorable summer of 2002 also marks my first foray into that territory. Fed up with the spaghetti, I recalled a particular Provençal-style soup my mum once made, and attempted to reproduce it. All I remembered was that it contained tomatoes, beans, herbes de Provence and a peculiar type of home-made dumpling, which is made with just wheat flour and egg dough (no filling), scooped up with a spoon and put in a boiling water for a few minutes. Consequently, I visited Elephant & Castle Asda store and purchased a few cans of baked beans, peeled plum tomatoes, eggs, flour, herbs, onion and garlic. It all cost about a pound, and the result was a reasonably tasty soup that lasted me a few days. I make variants of this soup until this day, though it does not cost a pound any more – both due to the monetary and lifestyle inflation.</p><p>To start with, finely chop <strong>two onions</strong>, heat some olive oil in a large pot and soften the onion on low heat for a few minutes. Add <strong>whole allspice</strong> and <strong>bay leaf</strong>, fry for another minute or two, but without browning the onion. If you would like the spicy version of the soup, you might want to add at this stage a few <strong>chillies</strong>, cut lengthwise and deseeded. Add two or three cans of <strong>chopped tomatoes</strong> in tomato sauce, mix and let it heat up. Press a few cloves of <strong>garlic</strong>, add <strong>herbes de Provence</strong>. It might be a good idea to add little bit of <strong>tomato purée</strong> for more intense tomato flavour. Pour in half a litre of <strong>stock</strong> (vegetable or chicken works well), to make it a liquid, then bring to boil. Grind in some black pepper. Add more herbes de Provence. Throw in a few cans of various types of <strong>beans</strong> – I always use butter beans and red kidney beans, cannellini or borlotti beans also work well. Bring to boil again, and boil on a low heat for 5 or 10 minutes, stirring frequently. You might want to cover the pot, since the relatively thick mixture has a tendency to sputter and make a mess of everything around.</p><p>For the dumplings, break two or three whole <strong>eggs</strong> into a pint glass, add a spoon of <strong>wheat flour</strong> and mix into a loose dough. Keep gradually adding more flour until the dough is quite thick. I usually melt a spoonful of <strong>butter</strong> and add to the dough – I am not sure how much difference it makes, but it is part of my mum’s recipe, so I am sticking to it. Bring a small pot of lightly salty water to boil, scoop bits of dough with the tip of a spoon and put them in the water. After every eight or ten dumplings, take them out of the water and leave in a sieve or a colander to drain. Meanwhile, cook the next batch; put the drained dumplings in the pot with the soup.</p><p>The soup lasts the two of us a good few days and is perfect for the cold autumn and winter evenings. Serve with chopped fresh <strong>parsley</strong>.</p><p><img src=https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7615937576_bb1d8a3c57_z.jpg alt="the soup"></p></main><footer><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:["script","noscript","style","textarea","pre"]}}</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><hr>© Maciek Makowski 2010 &ndash; 2022.
