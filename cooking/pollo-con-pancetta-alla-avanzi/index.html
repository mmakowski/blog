There are some which I would like to share my take on, like Jamie’s fish linguine – I even have a nice photo taken already – but going for something so much borrowed would require considerable literary embellishment, which recently I have felt incapable of.</p><p>So, Jamie’s fish will have to wait; meanwhile, leftovers to the rescue of creative spirit! Half of a small swede has been lingering in the corner of my fridge for too long and today I have finally decided to challenge this sad state of affairs. A search on what is nowadays my primary source of culinary ideas, BBC Good Food website, produced a promising <a href=http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/8095/swede-mash>swede mash</a>. To be honest, I was not so much excited by the mash itself, as by the opportunity to try out the new <a href=http://www.braun.com/global/household/food-preparation/multiquick-hand-blenders/multiquick-5.html>Braun Multiquick 5</a> we had delivered yesterday.</p><p>My dear wife, as much as she supports my cooking endavours, would probably not be amused by the prospect of dinner consisting entirely of swede mash, so I picked a couple of additional items at random: two small, organic chicken breasts, a pack of pancetta, a tomato and a small onion. The chicken ended up wrapped in pancetta and cooked uncovered for 25 minutes in a 180°C oven; tomato and onion had been thinly sliced and with some addition of black pepper and olive oil acted as a salatary ersatz. The chicken was then served on a bed of swede mash.</p><p>As you can probably deduce from the fact that I decided to share this recipe, all in all the result was interesting. The sweetness of the swede, the salty-smokiness of pancetta, the familiarity of tomato and onion, spiciness of roasted chilli (another leftover which I couldn’t help not to throw in its entirety into the dish with the chicken) together made for an enjoyable, if simple, dish.</p><p><img src=https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6220/6348067335_9938cc2864_m.jpg alt="the Braun Multiquick blender"></p><p>And last but not least, the Multiquick 5 did its job to a satisfactory standard. I didn’t manage to take any pictures before the food was gone, so let the silent hero of the evening feature as an illustration of this experiment.</p></main><p class=date>10/11/2011</p><footer><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:["script","noscript","style","textarea","pre"]}}</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><hr>© Maciek Makowski 2010 &ndash; 2022.
