Turns out that the navigation and presentation could be a bit better, but overall it seems to be fairly usable. And since the tutorial has the form of a git repository, we are not restricted to using Github, but can come up with software that is specifically designed to present the subsequent commits as steps of a tutorialâ€¦ clearly, DVCS and self-contained repositories are very powerful ideas.</description></item></channel></rss>
