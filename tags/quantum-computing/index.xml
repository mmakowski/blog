Up until a few years ago all work in this domain was about building theoretical models of what will be possible once we have a quantum computer. Today, a number of companies have built and made available physical quantum computers. So far those are toy-size, proofs of concept, with no practical application, but this gives hope that practical devices will become available in a few yearsâ€™ time, so wider community should take notice.</description></item></channel></rss>
