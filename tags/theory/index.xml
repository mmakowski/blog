The function $\hat{f}$ is referred to as a model. The goal of machine learning is to construct the model in such a way that its results on $X\in\mathcal{X}\setminus T$ are close – according to some measure – to $f(X)$.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Lambda Calculus</title><link>https://mmakowski.github.io/blog/technology/introduction-to-lambda-calculus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmakowski.github.io/blog/technology/introduction-to-lambda-calculus/</guid><description>Software is pervasive in the modern world and has influence over many aspects of our lives. In some cases, such as avionics or medical equipment control, human life depends on the correctness of software. Yet, high profile cases of bugs do not inspire confidence in the state of software engineering.
The “software crisis” is a phenomenon recognised by practitioners of the field. Several ways of addressing the reliability issue have been proposed: from reliance on programmer’s discipline, through tools that perform post-hoc validation of programs to ensure they do not contain suspicious coding patterns, to languages that restrict valid programs to ones whose properties can be formally proven.</description></item></channel></rss>
