So, we have picked the location that is close to the slopes, so that we do not have to take a bus, or walk for 20 minutes in ski boots, and that is not going to break the bank – but other considerations, such as well-equipped kitchen or proximity to the shops inevitably were of secondary importance. We could eat in the resturant, sure, but if we could afford the extortionate prices the resort eateries charge, then presumably we could have stayed in a proper hotel instead of a holiday apartment?</description></item><item><title>Sailor Fodder</title><link>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/sailor-fodder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/sailor-fodder/</guid><description>Picture this: you try to bring a massive pot of water to boil to cook some rice. The meal was supposed to be served 15 minutes ago, and the water still refuses to boil. Suddenly, the floor lurches from underneath your feet, you are violently thrown against the cooker and only a small miracle saves you from third-degree burns. Eventually, you manage to put some rice into the water, and after another half an hour there is some hope it might have softened a little.</description></item><item><title>Sans Marigold</title><link>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/sans-marigold/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/sans-marigold/</guid><description>I like travelling a lot – that is, I like it a lot to travel, rather than travelling a lot is what I like – getting to know different cultures, cuisines, all that stuff. Those of you who understand Polish, or are willing to suffer automated translation, can read more about my travel exploits on another blog. This year I have been to Greece and Georgia, and if there is anything common between those two escapades, it is that in those lands of highly regarded cuisine I ended up enjoying salads the most.</description></item><item><title>A Proper Fruit Salad</title><link>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/a-proper-fruit-salad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/a-proper-fruit-salad/</guid><description>Fruit salads do not enjoy a good reputation, and perhaps deservedly so. At supermarkets and sandwich joints, what passes as a “fruit salad” is usually nothing more than some random pieces of fruit approaching use-by date diced and sealed in a plastic container. At restaurants, dietetic martyrs who with sad resignation skim through the dessert menu and then announce they will have a fruit salad, attract sympathetic looks and knowing nods.</description></item><item><title>Roasted Root Vegetables</title><link>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/roasted-root-vegetables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mmakowski.com/cooking/roasted-root-vegetables/</guid><description>Commonly when preparing the main course we start with the choice of meat (if any) and the way to cook it, and then treat the vegetables, rice etc. as an addition. For today’s course I’m doing something opposite: make vegetables the cetrepiece, with meat acting as a side dish. The first time I ate something similar was in December 2009 in Lapland, with -30°C outside, so somehow naturally I associate it with winter.</description></item></channel></rss>
