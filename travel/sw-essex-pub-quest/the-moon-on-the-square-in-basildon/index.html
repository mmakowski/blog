I used to swear by them. The ales for under two pounds a pint – and good too! The gourmet burgers, the curries, all cheap and cheerful. Sure, they’ve lost some of the appeal with this whole brexit thing. The good-old-times interiors seem less welcoming than five years ago, magazines spew out pro-brexit propaganda and today we could even hear a guest asking the waitress in an unfriendly manner “You don’t speak English! Where did you come from?”. Yet, the thing is: Weatherspoons is the pub chain to end all pub chains. There is simply nothing else that offers similar balance of choice, quality and value for money. I do have misgivings about the political activism of JD Weatherspoons owner, but I don’t think a boycott of this business would do anyone any good, so this lunchtime we went to Moon On The Square in central Basildon.</p><p>The pub is next door to our last week’s feature, <a href=/travel/sw-essex-pub-quest/the-beehive-in-basildon/>The Beehive</a>. The decor is actually fairly similar, again with slot machines taking a prominent place in the very middle of the hall. The prices are even lower. The ale selection is in a different league to all the places we’ve visited so far: 8 real ales on the tap, each for £1.99, I tried Wakering Gold from George’s Brewery and it was very good. In addition there is a limited selection of bottled and canned craft beers. Nothing to complain about on this front. This being Thursday, it was a curry day, so I went for lamb Rogan Josh, which was a marked improvement on Beehive’s chicken tikka last week: the curry itself was alright, nothing special, but the rice was actually pilau basmati, there was a naan and the popadums were tasty. Z loves that they have a dedicated vegetarian and vegan menu and, went for noodles teriyaki (which tasted more like black bean than teriyaki to me). When ordering, I was asked if we want chicken with that, so perhaps vegetarianism has not caught on in Basildon yet. Of course, for £6 or so the quality and execution are not going to be top notch; we could put together a meal of similar quality by throwing together a few ready-made ingredients from Tesco’s. That said, the food was quite alright, and served very quickly.</p><p>I’ve known this place for years, and Whetherspoons itself since my early days in the UK, so this lunch was not a revelation, just a confirmation that Moon On The Square is <em>the</em> place to have lunch in Basildon centre.</p><h3 id=the-z-score>The Z-Score</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Availability of vegan food</td><td>★★★</td></tr><tr><td>Food quality</td><td>★★★</td></tr><tr><td>Drinks</td><td>★★★</td></tr><tr><td>Ambience</td><td>★★</td></tr><tr><td>Surroundings</td><td>★</td></tr><tr><td>Bathrooms</td><td>★★★</td></tr><tr><td>Service</td><td>★★</td></tr><tr><td>Cheapness</td><td>★★★★</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=moononthesquare.jpg alt="blurry photo of the pub interior"></p></main><p class=date>06/06/2019</p><footer><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:["script","noscript","style","textarea","pre"]}}</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><hr>© Maciek Makowski 2010 &ndash; 2022.
