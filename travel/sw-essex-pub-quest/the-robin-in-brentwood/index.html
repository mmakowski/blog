Located in the North of the town, not far from A12, by a main street, this was an interesting change from chains to a local. Inside a small bar, regulars watching a football match, a few tables, most of the free ones were in the vicinity of a particularly noisy group of children. The garden outside with a view onto a busy street, we opted for a table inside. Only two ales on the tap, one of them inescapable Greene King IPA, but the other – yay! – Doombar. That’s a good start. No craft beer bottles or cans anywhere to be seen, but Doombar will do just fine.</p><p>The menu is “American”, i.e. it has mac’n’cheese and burgers named “Texan”, “New York” and “Mexican”. The burgers start at £11, pricey, but perhaps that’s commesurate with quality, so I order one. There is a dedicated vegan section of the menu with three options to choose from, shepherd’s pie is Z’s pick. The food is nicely presented and voluminous, the salad very good; sadly the burger does not live up to its hefty price – the patty looks like it’s made from heavily processed substance ground into a paste with bubbles of air, offering no discernible texture and cooked to the state where all moisture evaporated. At the end I feel bloated and not really satisfied with the quality. That might partially be my fault, as not being super hungry I could have chosen something lighter, but a burger is always tempting. Z’s impression of the vegan shepherd’s pie was not much different, so it is fair to say that we were not particularly impressed with the food.</p><p>Despite unattractive surroundings, and slightly disappointing first food impression (in particular considering the price), the Robin is pleasant enough inside, serves (one) proper ale, and while not really a place I would specifically travel to, if passing by, why not pop in for a pint of Doombar, and perhaps a light snack?</p><p><img src=robin.jpg alt="a blurry photo of the pub interior"></p></main><p class=date>18/05/2019</p><footer><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:["script","noscript","style","textarea","pre"]}}</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><hr>© Maciek Makowski 2010 &ndash; 2022.
